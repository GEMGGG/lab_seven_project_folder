    <p>Hello welcome to my page! If you look above this paragraph you will see some links to my favorite games, movies and music. Click on the links to learn more about what my favorites are.</p>
     
    <p><u>Marvel Rivals</u>, Is on the top of my list of games because of its engaging gameplay, good dev team, and the ability to play as my favorite Marvel characters(Cloak and Dagger). I saw some YouTubers playing the closed beta of this game 
        6 months ago and thought it looked a bit dumb and just a Overwatch copy. However when the game officially released two months ago I tried it and to my surprise got instantly addicted. I have almost 300 hours on the game and spent at least $50 so far.<br/>
        <u>The Isle</u>, Has been one of my favorite Games for three years now, I first discovered it on TikTok while searching for new games to get. I'll never get bored of the Isle because of the variety of dinosaurs you can play as, the realism of the game, and the fun toxic community it has. In this survival game, you can choose different kinds of dinosaurs you want to be
        and grow as it can take 1 to 6 hours to grow a dino in The Isle. I have 2,500 hours on This game and have enjoyed every hour, highly recommend it to anyone who likes dinosaurs(game has crazy fps drops though).<br/>
        <u>Path Of Titans</u>, is a game I've been playing for two years. its like the isle but less realistic and more aimed towards fighting than surviving. I found it through YouTube while searching for more dinosaur survival games. It has more dinosaurs than The Isle and more mechanics.<br/></p>

    <p><u>Spider-Man:No Way home</u>, I've been a fan of Spider-Man since I was like 9, I've watched every movie and so hearing they were going to make a movie about all three Spideys(Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) meeting was a dream come true. The most insane moment of the movie was when Andrew Garfields Spider-Man saved MJ from falling off the building, It made you instantly remember when "Andrew" couldn't save Gwen in time from falling off the clock tower in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.<br/>
        <u>Strange Magic</u>, I first watched this movie when I was about 13, It is an animated fantasy adventure with romance and singing. The thing that I love most about this movie would be the animation and detail, I don't think I've seen any Disney movies come close to this masterpiece(I can think of plenty of movies but I love Strange Magic).<br/>
        <u>Shazam</u>, When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to be really silly and funny and I was correct it was hilarious. The action in this movie was incredible, I wasn't expecting all his siblings to get powers as well.<br/></p>

    <p><u>Die With A Smile - Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars</u>, This song was released last year and I've probably listened to it more than 200 times, It reminds you that you don't live forever, so you should treasure every moment.<br/>
        <u>這樣很好 (Isha’s Song) - Arcane, Eason Chan</u>, While watching Arcane this song came on during an emotional scene where Isha sacrifices herself to save Jinx and it made me feel like I was actually going through grief.<br/> 
        <u>The Line - Arcane, Twenty One Pilots</u>, Also a song from Arcane, Love this song and the lyric "I can feel the light shine on my face".<br/>
        <u>To Ashes and Blood - Arcane, Woodkid</u>, This is a Song from Arcane too, all the music they make is 10/10. Listening to this makes me feel determined, and I really like the part of the show when this song comes on.<br/></p>
