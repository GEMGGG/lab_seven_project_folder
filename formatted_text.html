            <h2>Looking</h2>
            <p><em><strong> I brought my snake home in late 2022...</em></strong> <br/>
                Getting a snake was a <i>dream</i> I had for many years and After much anticipation my parents <b>finally</b> agreed to let me get one. 
                My dad took my sister and me to a vibrant reptile convention, where we were surrounded by an array of lizards, spiders, and turtles. 
                it was overwhelming to experience such a diverse collection of creatures in one place. Amid all the reptiles, I was drawn to a stunning white snake with a price tag of <u>$2,000.</u> 
                I did consider buying it; However, as a first-time reptile owner I wasn't confident I could provide the care that such a costly pet would require. I continued to explore until I discovered a small,unpretentious snake; 
                his tiny black eyes captivated me, and I felt an immediate connection. Although my dad suggested we could find something more impressive, I was resolved in my choice.

            <h3>purchasing</h3>
            <p>As the convention began to wind down, I persuaded my dad to allow me to purchase the snake that had captured my heart. 
                I hurried to the vendor, relieved to find the charming little snake still <i>nestled</i> in a cup. 
                When my dad encouraged me to hold him and I picked him up for the first time and <b>I knew</b> he was the one.
                This little snake was remarkably affordable at just <u>$40</u>, a much more manageable price compared to the white one. 
                After our purchase, we also acquired a heating pad and a <u>10-gallon</u> tank to provide him with a suitable home. 
                I was eager to see my moms reaction when I revealed that we had also bought a few baby mice for his meals; her startled shriek was hilarious!

            <h4>Home</h4>
            <p>Upon returning home, I carefully set up his enclosure, ensuring he had everything he neededâ€”fresh water, cozy hiding spots, and the right temperature. 
                I followed the advice of professionals to avoid handling him for the first couple of weeks, allowing him to acclimate and start eating regularly.
                Fast forward nearly two years, and my little snake named <strong><i><q>worm</q></i></strong> has blossomed into a beautiful silly creature now residing in a spacious <u>45-gallon tank.</u> 
                He has grown remarkably and now enjoys a diet of small rats, showcasing just how far hes come.<br/> 
                <em><strong>Witnessing his transformation has been truly incredible.</strong></em>
